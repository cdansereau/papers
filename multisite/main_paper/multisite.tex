\section{Introduction}

% Magic paragraph
Resting-state (RS) connectivity in fMRI is a promising biomarker for a variety of neurological diseases. Typically, in a clinical trial, a large cohort is recruited and evaluated at multiple sites spread over countries or even continents. The main potential issue with that approach is the lack of consistency in the multi-site RS connectivity acquisitions that may obscure clinically relevant information. Therefore the aims of the study were to: (1) characterize the amplitude of the site bias, i.e. the systematic differences in rs-fMRI connectivity across different acquisition sites; (2) Quantify the impact of the between-site variance on the power of statistical tests in resting-state fMRI.

The number of Canadians suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly increasing, with tremendous social and economic impact. Despite the emergence of promising drugs, the recent clinical trials with demented patients have failed. Dementia however comes very late in the development of the disease, at a stage where the degeneration of neural tissues has likely gone beyond repair. In order to be efficient, therapies should be initiated in the decades predating dementia, in a preclinical stage where patients experience no or very mild symptoms (see chapter $1.1$). There are unfortunately no biomarker(s) that are currently predictive of AD in this preclinical stage, and could help identify the individuals that could benefit from such interventions. A promising technique is resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), which may be able to capture the early synaptic dysfunction seen in AD (see chapter $1.2$). I order to be able to apply statistical analysis and machine learning methods we 
need to preprocess the data to remove as much as possible the effect of various artefacts (hardware and physiological). The preprocessing reduces the variability of the data and therefore provides more relevant and discriminative features (see chapter $1.3$). In order to further improve the statistical power of there analysis, multiple academic groups are collaborating to pool their dataset to increase the sample size of the study. Unfortunately the gain in sample size comes with a new source of variability introduced by the multicentric acquisition. Site-specific MRI set-ups may bias the fMRI measures, and I am thus developing procedures for inter-site normalization. Account for these sources of variance are important since they may bias the predictive potential of rs-functional connectivity in a multi-site, in line with this last assumption we want to quantify the robustness of the feature selection and classifier to multi-site acquisition (see chapter $1.4$).

In most experiments conducted in neuroimaging, the main factors that influence power are: (1) the size of the effect, determined by the difference of the mean connectivity of one group versus a control group and the variability of this difference across subjects and groups; and (2) the sample size, i.e. the number of subjects in the study \citep{Desmond2002}. This last factor is usually the only one controlled by the investigator, hence why an increasing number of researchers share multicentric, sometimes multiprotocol, data suitable to statistical analysis. In research it is very difficult to obtain a grant large enough to scan a cohort larger than ~80 subjects, therefore researcher and consortium initiatives have started to pool their resources together to make initiative composed of publicly available large cohorts of subjects like the 1000 functional connectome \citep{Biswal2010}, ADNI \citep{
Mueller2005}, among 
others. In clinical trial the justification for multicentric acquisition is more of a logistical one then a financial reason; they need to recruit a large amount of subject in a short period of time. In order to achieve this goal they mandate the recruitment to multiple clinical centers across the globe which accelerate the evaluation time of a drug. Although these centers may be similar by their scanner protocols, scanners will have difference in their software version, specific add-on to the scanners, and, most importantly, vendors (even field strength may differ in some cases). Unfortunately between studies, MR acquisition methodologies are among the most commonly cited sources of measurement variation \citep{Friedman2006}. This is why it is important to assess if multi-site resting-state connectivity analysis are feasible (we can combine the data from multiple sources while introducing a reasonable amount of variance which is still acceptable to detect effects in the data) and what corrective measure on 
the data should be applied to reduce the bias introduced by multi-site analysis. Among the factor of variability across sites, we can list the following 3 categories described in \citep{Yan2013a}:



\textbf{How can we increase the statistical power?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of subject mechanically increase the statistical power (sensitivity) of a study.
\item Collecting a large sample size is very expensive.
\item Recruitment may be difficult at a single site.
\item Large sample size can be achieved in multisite study.
\item Multisite studies come with problems of their own.
\end{itemize}

\item Characterize the amplitude of inter-site bias.
\item Quantify the impact of inter-site biases on the detection power of a rs-fMRI effect.
\item Evaluate our ability to correct for inter-site variance using a statistical model.
\end{enumerate}


In 2009, the publicly released 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) provided a glimpse of the variability in imaging methodologies employed by the neuroimaging field. The dataset includes rs-fMRI samples independently collected at imaging sites around the world. A noteworthy aspect of this dataset is the variation in almost every parameter of the imaging acquisition methodologies, while the majority of subject-related variables are not reported (due in most cases, to the fact that they were not thoroughly recorded). 
Despite justifiable scepticism, feasibility analyses demonstrated that meaningful explorations of the aggregate dataset, composed of 24 imaging sites for a grand total of 1093 subjects, could be performed \citep{Biswal2010}. Although no explicit correction for multi-site variability was used, they only use global signal correction (GSC) to normalize subjects which may introduce anti-correlation in the data \citep{Fox2009, Murphy2009, Saad2012, Carbonell2014, Power2014}. After accounting for site-related differences, the analysis showed brain-behaviour relationships with phenotypic variables such as age, gender, and diagnostic label, and confirmed a variety of prior hypotheses \citep{Biswal2010, Fair2012, Tomasi2010, Zuo2012}. While encouraging, many uncontrolled and unknown factors in the 1000 FCP remain a source of concern, as they spread beyond simple site effects and can limit the datasets utility as highlighted by \cite{Yan2013}.
An other compelling proof of multi-site bias is the study reported by \cite{Nielsen2013} where they did an analysis on a single site dataset and a multi-site dataset of subject with autism and concluded that the multi-site autism study classification accuracy significantly outperformed chance but was much lower for multi-site prediction than for previous single site results \citep{Nielsen2013}. We therefore need to keep in mind that the site effect must be taken in account in the analysis or we may reduce our detection power.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Data samples} 

\paragraph{Participants}
The paper studies 345 cognitively normal young adults (CNY) from the 1000 functional connectome project\footnote{\url{http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/}} (150 males, age range = 18-46 yrs) as a reference dataset. One of the particularity of this dataset is the presence of one large site of $\sim200$ subjects and 7 small sites of $\sim20$ subjects per site. We are therefore able to simulate realistic scenarios where we model the variability of a real monosite and the variability introduce by combining small sites into a large sample of the same total sample size, see Table \ref{table_dataset} for more details on each site. The experimental protocols for all datasets were approved by there respective ethic boards.

\paragraph{Acquisition} %Resting-state scans were acquired on a 3T Siemens TrioTim for all datasets. One single run was obtained per subject for either the SCHIZO or BLIND dataset while two runs were acquired in each subject for the MOTOR dataset, one immediately preceding and one following the practice on a motor task. 
%For the 1000 functional connectom dataset, 150 EPI volumes were recorded in 6 mins 40 s (TR = 2.65s, TE = 30ms, FA = 90\textdegree, 43 slices, voxel size = 3.4x3.4x3 mm$^3$, gap = 10\%, matrix size = 64x64, FOV = 220x220 mm$^2$), and a structural image was acquired using a MPRAGE sequence (TR = 2.3~s, TE = 2.98~ms, FA = 9\textdegree, 176 slices, voxel size = 1x1x1 mm$^3$, matrix size = 256x256, FOV = 256x256 mm$^2$).

We need to discuss how to present this data (I dont have the details for each site...)

\subsection{Preprocessing}\label{Preprocessing}
The datasets were analysed using the NeuroImaging Analysis Kit (NIAK\footnote{\url{http://www.nitrc.org/projects/niak/}}) version 0.12.14, under CentOS version 6.3 with Octave\footnote{\url{http://gnu.octave.org}} version 3.8.1 and the Minc toolkit\footnote{\url{http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/ServicesSoftwareMincToolKit}} version 0.3.18. Analyses were executed in parallel on the "Mammouth" supercomputer\footnote{\url{http://www.calculquebec.ca/index.php/en/resources/compute-servers/mammouth-parallele-ii}}, using the pipeline system for Octave and Matlab \citep{Bellec2010}, version 1.0.2. Brain map visualizations were created using MRICron software \cite{Rorden2007}. Each fMRI dataset was corrected of inter-slice difference in acquisition time and the parameters of a rigid-body motion was estimated for each time frame. Rigid-body motion was estimated within as well as between runs, using the median volume of the first run as a target. The median volume of one selected fMRI run for each subject 
was 
coregistered with a T1 individual scan using Minctracc \citep{Collins1998}, which was itself non-linearly transformed to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template \citep{Fonov2011} using the CIVET pipeline \citep{Zijdenbos2002}. The MNI symmetric template was generated from the ICBM152 sample of 152 young adults, after 40 iterations of non-linear coregistration. The rigid-body transform, fMRI-to-T1 transform and T1-to-stereotaxic transform were all combined, and the functional volumes were resampled in the MNI space at a 3 mm isotropic resolution. A censoring method described in \citep{Power2012} called "scrubbing" was used to remove the volumes with excessive motion using a cut-off value of $FD\geq0.5$. A minimum number of 50 unscrubbed volumes per run, corresponding to $\sim 125$ s of acquisition for a TR of 2.5 seconds, was then required for further analysis. The following nuisance parameters were regressed out from the time series at each voxel: slow time drifts (basis of discrete cosines 
with a 0.01 Hz high-pass cut-off), average signals in conservative masks of the white matter and the lateral ventricles as well as the first principal components (95\% energy) of the six rigid-body motion parameters and their squares \citep{Lund2006},\citep{Giove2009}. The fMRI volumes were finally spatially smoothed with a 6 mm isotropic Gaussian blurring kernel. 


\subsection{Functional networks}

\paragraph{Functional parcellation}
Regions are routinely defined using an anatomical parcellation \citep{He2009}, such as the AAL template \citep{Tzourio-Mazoyer2002}. Anatomical parcels may however not well match the brain functional organization. In this work, we used functional brain parcellations, aimed at defining groups of brain regions with homogeneous time series. A number of algorithms have been proposed with additional spatial constraints, to ensure that the resulting parcels are spatially connected \citep{Lu2003,Thirion2006,Craddock2012}. We can achive this aime and To reduce the computational burden of the analysis using a region-growing algorithm \cite{Bellec2006},  resulting in more homogenius regions composed of temporaly similar and contigus voxels. The spatial dimension was selected arbitrarily by setting the size where the growing process stopped (a threshold of 1000 mm3 resulted into R=957 regions) from a reference dataset of healthy adults from the 1000 functional connectome project (Cambridge cohort \citep{Biswal2010}, parcelation available here \ref{}). The regions were built to maximize the homogeneity of the time series within the region, i.e. the average correlation between the time series associated with any pair of voxels of the region. The region growing was applied on the time series concatenated across all subjects (after correction to zero mean and unit variance), such that the homogeneity was maximized on average for all subjects, and the small homogeneous regions are identical for all subjects. Because of the temporal concatenation of time series, we had to limit the memory demand, and the region-growing was thus applied independently in each of the 116 areas of the AAL template \citep{Tzourio-Mazoyer2002}. See \cite{Bellec2006} for more details regarding the implementation of the region-growing algorithm. Overall, this process reduced the dataset of each subject into a (T x R) data array, where T is the number of time samples and R is the number of regions.

\paragraph{Functional network decomposition}
From a pure functional viewpoint, the spatial constraint seems somewhat arbitrary, as functional units in the brain at low resolution encompass distributed networks of brain regions with homotopic regions often being part of a single parcel \citep{DeLuca2006,Damoiseaux2006}. Some works have thus used distributed parcels as the spatial units to measure functional brain connectivity, e.g. \citep{Jafri2007,Marrelec2008}. We relied on a recent method called “Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters” (BASC), which can identify consistent functional networks for a group of subjects \citep{Biswal2010}. using a hierarchical cluster with Ward’s criterion both at the individual and the group levels. The functional networks can be generated at any arbitrary scale (within the range of the fMRI resolution), and we considered only networks generated at the group level, which were non-overlapping and not necessarily spatially contiguous. In the present work we generated a BASC decomposition in 100 networks.

TODO: cite the NATURE paper of Pierre Orban for parcelation and connections selection.

\paragraph{Functional connectome}
Using a brain partition of $R$ networks obtain from BASC procedure described in \cite{Bellec2010c}, and taking each pair of distinct networks $i$ and $j$, the between-network connectivity $y_{i,j}$ is measured by the Fisher transform of the Pearson's correlation between the average time series of the network. The within-network connectivity $y_{i,i}$ is the Fisher transform of the average correlation between time series of every pair of distinct voxels inside network $i$. The connectome $\mathbf{Y}=(y_{i,j})_{i,j=1}^R$ is thus a $R\times R$ matrix. Each column $j$ (or row, as the matrix is symmetric) codes for the connectivity between network $j$ and all other brain networks (full brain functional connectivity map). For a scale with $R$ parcels, there are exactly $L=R(R+1)/2$ distinct elements in an individual connectome $\mathbf{Y}$.

\subsection{Simulations}

\paragraph{Power analysis for a resting-state fMRI study}
A Monte-Carlo simulation was implemented to evaluate the power of a resting-state multi-site study. For each site and each sample, $B\%$ of the subjects were randomly assigned to a 'treatment' group. For the subjects in this group, a value was added to achieve a given relative effect size (Cohen's d, i.e. the mean of the two groups divided by the standard deviation of all sites). The significance of the difference between the control and 'treatment' group was assessed by a $t$-test in a linear model. To account for site-specific bias we have included dummy variables in the GLM model. The study was repeated for various effect sizes (0 to 1.5 with a step of 0.01) at a threshold of 0.001 on the p-value in the $t$-test.

In order to simulate various scenarios within the context of a multi-site setting, a cohort of subjects acquired at a single-site was selected to act as our reference dataset and for the multi-site configuration a cohort from a collection of small sites, roughly totalling the same sample size as the reference dataset, was used. The simulation was based on a scenario with 8 sites for a total of 345 subjects, and no homogeneization of acquisition protocol whatsoever. The multi-site (with correction) is based on 150 subjects from 7 sites and the monosite is based on 
one site of 195 subjects.  


\paragraph{Estimation of the detection sensitivity}
Based on the literature review previously described in (TODO: cite the NATURE paper of Orban2015) reporting 10 reproducible pair of regions reported to be affected by Alzheimer disease progression and displayed connectivity changes between cognitively normal subjects and patient with dementia of the Alzheimer type. The following confounding variables were modelled in the general linear model (GLM) analysis: frame displacement (FD). Significance of the results is obtain with a Student $t$-test and the sensitivity of the test is evaluated by sub-sampling 70\% of the dataset ($B=10^3$ random samples). For each sample $b$, we have a $p$-value $p^{*}_b$ and the detection sensitivity is estimated by the probability of $p^{*}_b$ being inferior to $0.001$.
\begin{equation}\label{Detection power}  
    \frac{1}{B}\sum\limits_{b=1}^B\left(p^{*}_b\leq0.001\right).
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Effect size (cohen's d)}
For each site and each sample, half of the subjects were randomly assigned to a "treatment" group and a Monte-Carlo simulation was used to estimate the detection power in the single-site and in multi-site setting.

The normalized Cohen's d was used to estimate the effect size and it is defined as the difference between two means $\bar{x_{1}},\bar{x_{2}}$ divided by a standard deviation from the data $s$.

For each site an effect is added to the connectivity of $B\%$ of the subjects, selected randomly ("pathological" group):
\begin{equation}
	y_{i,j} = y_{i,j} + \mu.
\end{equation}

The parameter $\mu$ is chosen to obtain a particular effect size (measured by the Cohen $d$)
%The normalized Cohen's d was used to estimate the effect size and it is defined as the difference between two means $\bar{x_{1}},\bar{x_{2}}$ divided by a standard deviation from the data $s$.
\begin{equation}\label{cohen's d}
    \begin{array}{l l}
      d = \frac{\mu}{s_{i,j}},      
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
where $s_{i,j}$ is the standard deviation between region $i$ and $j$ for the reference population (mono-site, Cambridge). The significance of the difference between the control and 'treatment' group was assessed by a $t$-test in a linear model, including a covariate to model the motion. The study was repeated for various effect sizes (0 to 0.8 with a step of 0.01) with a $p$-value threshold of $0.001$ on the $t$-test.

In order to introduce the same effect-size across the single-site and multi-site dataset we are taking the standard deviation from the single-site cohort as the reference.  The connection $y_{i,j}$ of the randomly affected subjects ("treatment" group) are therefore calculated $y_{i,j} = y_{i,j} + d\times s_{i,j}$. 

\paragraph{multi-site correction approache} 

%For the multi-site three flavours were computed: multi-site no correction, multi-site with dummy variables and multi-site with METAL correction.
%Depending on the multi-site configuration and distribution of the subject we proposed two corrective approaches that can be applied as shown in the simulations of Figure \ref{fig_simu_50pct}. 
In order to obtain an unbiased method to combine sites and do group analysis on them we are using dummy variables (binary vectors $1\times S$) who code for each site in the GLM model ilustrated in Equation\ref{eq_glm_dummy}. The variables are corrected to have a zero mean across subjects, and an intercept (i.e. a column filled with 1) is added to $\mathbf{X}$. The GLM relies on the following stochastic model:

\begin{equation}
 \label{eq_glm_dummy}
  \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta} + \mathbf{V}\mathbf{\gamma}+ \mathbf{E},
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbf{Y}$: $N\times 1$, connectivity value for the pair ($i,j$),
  \item $\mathbf{X}$: $N\times K$, explainable variables,
  \item $\mathbf{\beta}$: $1 \times K$, regression values for each explainable variable,
  \item $\mathbf{V}$: $N\times S$, each column code for a site (0/1),
  \item $\mathbf{\gamma}$: $1\times S$, site average connectivity,
  \item $\mathbf{E}$: $N\times 1$, residual values from the regression,
\end{itemize}
 
with $N$ the number of subjects, $K$ the number of explainable variables and $S$ the number of sites. Where $\mathbf{\beta}$ is an unknown $1\times K$ vector of linear regression coefficients, $\mathbf{\gamma}$ is a $1\times S$ vector of linear regression coefficients representing the contribution of each site and $\mathbf{E}$ is a $N\times 1$ random (noise) multivariate Gaussian variable. As data generated from different subjects are statistically independent, and under an homoscedasticity assumption, the regression coefficients $\mathbf{\beta}$ can be estimated with ordinary least squares. To apply the correction $S-1$ dummy-variables are added to the model in Equation\ref{eq_glm_dummy} with $S$ being the total number of sites used in the study.


 
% The second approach is to compute the GLM independently on each site and then combine the statistical results from each site in a global score. This model averaging technique called METAL from \cite{Willer2010} model site specific bias by running a GLM analysis on each site resulting in $v$ beta vectors that are weighted proportionally to the standard error of each site and finally averaged as shown in equation \ref{METAL}. This is the most flexible way to account for multi-site effect wile keeping the analysis simple and robust to unbalanced sites.

% 	\beta_{v} \text{, effect size estimate for site \textit{v}.}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
% 	\sigma_{v} \text{, standard error for site} \textit{v}.

% 	p=2(1-\phi(\vert Z \vert) \text{, p-value.}

\paragraph{Framewise displacement (FD)}
Index measure of head motion from one frame to the other. It is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the differentiated realignment estimates at every time point \citep{Power2012} this measure give us an approximation of the motion frame by frame in millimeter. We are using this measure as an index of motion estimation.

\begin{equation}
    FD_{i} = \vert \triangle d_{x}(t) \vert + \vert \triangle d_{y}(t) \vert + \vert \triangle d_{z}(t) \vert + \vert \triangle r_x(t) \vert + \vert \triangle r_y(t) \vert + \vert \triangle r_z(t) \vert,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  r_x(t) = 50\left(\frac{2\pi\alpha_x(t)}{360}\right),
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{itemize}
 \item ($d_x(t),d_{y}(t),d_{z}(t)$) translation parameters (mm),
 \item ($\alpha_x(t),\alpha_y(t),\alpha_z(t)$) rotation parameters (degres),
 \item $\triangle$ difference between time $t$ et $t-1$.
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}

The Figure \ref{fig_icc} presents the results of the ICC analysis for the point-to-point correlations, 
%(a), regional clustering (b), regional degree centrality (c), global summary such as the average clustering, average efficiency and modularity (d) and local efficiency (e). 
only the connections with an average ICC above 0.5 are represented. The results were consistent with \citep{Shehzad2009}, with a mean ICC over all connections of \textasciitilde0.3 and 23 connections scoring a moderate-to-good level of ICC ($>0.5$). 

%In total, the literature review identified 7 nodes in the DMN (21 point-to-point correlations within the DMN) and 9 seeds in networks outside of the DMN (63 point-to-point correlations between a node in the DMN and a node outside of the DMN). We included three local network properties in the DMN (21 measures), as well as two global properties. That's a total of 107 candidate measures, based on a fairly conservative literature review. We further analyzed the test-retest reliability of these measures to narrow the selection down to about 10 measures. 

%The literature on TRT reliability of graph measures is much more difficult to interpret: \cite{Braun2012} for example has included many possible strategies to generate graph properties, resulting into almost the full range of possible ICC values for every metric ! Because no processing strategy was an obvious winner across all metrics, we selected the middle thresholding (20\% density) of \cite{Braun2012}. The relatively low ICC for graph measures (only a few measures with $ICC>0.5$, many measures with $ICC < 0.2$), was consistent with the results of \citep{Wang2011}.

% For point-to-point correlations within the DMN, we selected the connections with highest ICC for each node (all average ICC > 0.5):
% \begin{itemize}
% \item PCC x PCUN
% \item dMPFC x dMPFC2
% \item IPL x SFGr
% \item aMPFC x PCUN
% \end{itemize}

The first assessment perform on the dataset was to verify the distribution of the variance in functional connectivity among each site and across sites in order to see if they are of the same order of magnitude or not. This analysis of Figure \ref{fig_site_variability} shows the distribution of the standard deviation of connectivity across subjects (the distribution is over the full brain connectome, with several 1000s connections) at the 8 sites against the inter-sites standard deviation of connectomes (average at each site). as we can see the inter-site (between site) variability is smaller than the intra-site (between subjects) variability.

}
\label{fig_site_variability}
\end{figure}

In order to verify how spatial structure vary across sites the average standard deviation and the average connectivity map of the DMN was extracted for each site and displayed in Figure \ref{fig_DMN_variability}. In order to ease the reading we selected only 4 representative sites, although we reached the same conclusion on all the sites. As we can see in the intersection between two sites the difference in standard deviation between-sites was illustrated (red set of brain cuts). First the mean DMN at each site is consistent with the expected spatial ditribution reported in other studies. As we can see the amplitude of inter-site bias is about 3-fold smaller than the within-site standard deviation (red \textasciitilde0.06 vs. orange \textasciitilde0.18). The most salient changes between-sites are located in the mesio-frontal region associated with the anterior part of the DMN. This last finding may be associated with motion artefact as previously reported in \cite{Dansereau2014}.


The findings can be generalized on the full connectome see Figure \ref{fig_connectome_variability}.

We also showed using Monte-Carlo simulations that the power of detecting an effect is marginally affected by the site acquisition configuration (single site or multi-site, see Figure3.2 for an illustration of a power analysis on three different seeds) where the sites are balanced in term of the amount of subject with and without the effect.

% \section{Conclusion}
% 
% We confirmed that multi-site acquisition introduce some variability in the dataset although a single-site study with 200 subjects had only a marginally superior statistical power than an analysis pooling 7 sites for an equivalent number of subjects, see Figure \ref{fig_detection_power}. In both cases, a high sensitivity ($>0.95$) could be achieved for the effect size observed by \cite{Goveas2011} which reported an effect equivalent to 1. We can therefore conclude that it is feasible to acquire rs-fMRI data in across multiple sites and correct for this topology.

\section*{Literature review: Alzheimer’s disease and resting-state fMRI} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Zhang2009a} used functional connectivity maps with a seed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to explore the differences between a group of elderly cognitively normal subjects (CNE, n=16) and patients with a mild dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT, n=18).

\item \cite{Zhang2010} generalized the \cite{Zhang2009a} study with CNE (n=16) and a larger group of patients with DAT (n=46). Patients were separated in three groups (mild, moderate, severe DAT), and each group of patients was contrasted against the CNE.
\item \cite{Wang2006a} used functional connectivity maps with a seed in the hippocampi to explore the differences between a group of CNE (n=13) and patients with a mild DAT (n=13). All results included in the meta-analysis are from Table 2, seeded in the right hippocampus. Seeds were manually delineated on an individual basis.
\item \cite{Wang2007a} used functional connectivity maps with a seed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as well as full brain point-to-point correlations (based on an AAL parcellation) to explore the differences between a group of elderly cognitively normal subjects (CNE, n=14) and patients with a very mild to mild dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT, n=14). Only the results based on the PCC seed were included in the meta-analysis.
\item \cite{Goveas2011} used functional connectivity maps with a seed in the hippocampi to explore the differences between a group of elderly cognitively normal subjects (CNE, n=18) and patients with a mild dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT, n=14) before and after donepezil treatment. Seeds were manually delineated on an individual basis, before and after treatment.
\item \cite{Damoiseaux2012} used dual-regression independent component analysis to explore longitudinal differences between a group of CNE (n=18) and patients with DAT (n=21). All results included in the meta-analysis are from Table 3 (differences at baseline) and Table 4 (interaction with time). The authors used three components representing the Anterior DMN, Ventral DMN and Posterior DMN.
